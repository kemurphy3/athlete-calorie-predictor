CALORIE PREDICTION PLAN - FINAL VERSION
TrainingPeaks Take-Home Project

PROJECT OVERVIEW
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict calories burned for planned runs, addressing the core challenge that planned workouts often have missing data compared to completed workouts. This plan focuses on robust modeling fundamentals while demonstrating awareness of real-world ML challenges.

CORE CHALLENGE ANALYSIS
The fundamental problem: planned runs have significantly less data than completed runs. Our analysis shows:
- Planned runs typically have only duration and distance (30% data availability)
- Completed runs have heart rate, weight, age, sex, and other physiological data (100% data availability)
- Missing data creates a prediction gap that must be addressed through robust imputation strategies

KEY MODELING INSIGHTS
1. Data Leakage Prevention: Avoided using CALORIES_PER_MINUTE feature that would use target to predict target
2. Missing Data Transparency: Analyze missing data patterns before imputation for better understanding
3. Domain-Aware Features: Created pace, speed, and intensity ratio features aligned with running physiology
4. Robust Evaluation: Used cross-validation to ensure reliable performance estimates

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

PHASE 1: DATA UNDERSTANDING AND PREPARATION
- Load and sample large dataset efficiently
- Comprehensive data exploration with visualizations
- Identify data quality issues and establish cleaning thresholds
- Analyze missing data patterns before any imputation

PHASE 2: DATA CLEANING AND VALIDATION
- Remove invalid entries (negative calories, zero duration, etc.)
- Apply physiological range validation (heart rate, weight, age)
- Handle outliers using reasonable thresholds
- Ensure data consistency across all features

PHASE 3: FEATURE ENGINEERING
- Create derived features: pace, speed, intensity ratio
- Encode categorical variables (sex)
- AVOID data leakage: no features derived from target variable
- Focus on domain-relevant features that make physiological sense

PHASE 4: MISSING DATA STRATEGY
- Analyze missing data patterns before imputation
- Implement robust imputation for each feature type:
  * Numeric features: median imputation
  * Categorical features: mode imputation
  * Physiological features: sex/age-specific imputation
- Document imputation strategy for transparency

PHASE 5: MODEL DEVELOPMENT
- Use LightGBM for gradient boosting performance
- Implement cross-validation for robust performance estimation
- Train on imputed data to handle planned run scenarios
- Focus on model interpretability through feature importance

PHASE 6: MODEL EVALUATION
- Calculate MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² metrics
- Analyze feature importance for interpretability
- Validate model performance on test set
- Ensure predictions are reasonable and non-negative

PHASE 7: PREDICTION PIPELINE
- Create prediction function that handles missing input
- Apply same imputation strategy used in training
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Focus on practical usability for planned runs
